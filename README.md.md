For this assignment I started off by thinking about the layout and flow of a website that I could use to showcase as a portfolio and contain the required pages.

Index page
    Wanted to create a simple landing page for the user to land on and be able to easily navigate from. I used the Jumbotron code that we were shown just as a simple title frame and welcome the user to my site. 
    - Once I get a better idea of how I want my landing page to look. I will try to replace the image(s) with more proper professional image(s).
    - created the buttons to direct the user quickly and simply. 

About page
    I saw the template on w3schools.com and decided to use it since I liked the layout and it had features already laid out that I wanted to create or have on my resume page.
    I also liked that you it showed the % of a skill and this was a feature when I was planning out the page that I wanted to create or have.
    I have not been able to figure out how to change the colors on this page since the style CSS file is massive and I am still figuring out how to make changes. I will continue to edit this as well as the other pages as we progress and try to break it so I can change the colors or fonts to better fit the end look I have in mind. Might have to write a separate style sheet and use that. 
    - I have edited the skills to reflect the % of knowledge that I feel that I have for each of the programs and languages. Which I can update as the class progresses and as I continue to learn in my career.
    - I've tried to link the icons at the bottom to go to my actual pages but can't get it so you can click on just the icon and not the text that was showing next to each icon. Which I feel is a cleaner look.

Portfolio page
    I used to like the "flip book" look the old iTunes app had when you would flip through your music catalog. So, I wanted to try and recreate that feature. Which I think is probably some proprietary software that is only Apple. 
    I do like the slideshow for now to show case images and such but as I am typing this Readme, I am thinking I may have to re-think my layout to better suit a website link portfolio. Or least have sections for different aspects, i.e. website, graphic design, photography, etc.  So, I may try to change things out at the 11th hour on Friday. 

Contact page
    Just a simple contact form that I pulled from w3schools to use. Not sure what changes I want to make for this as this would just be a form for a client to reach me for questions or work.
    - added another line for email address since the form did not have a line for that. But guess it could have been entered in the subject box.
    - changed the submit box colors as the green that was originally.
